Some years ago I was excited about writing and I wanted (as I often do) to write more.

In my complete ignorance I thought that adding analytics and view metrics to my website would somehow motivate me to write more.

That in knowing that there are people reacting, liking, sharing (ü§£) and actually reading posts that I would write and so I added analytics to my personal blog. Pretty standard, nothing too special.

Took me only a couple of hours probably (don‚Äôt really remember but its nothing special these days to add all sorts of analytics to a website).

What followed was quite interesting. I stoped writing completely (I was already not writing a lot to be fair).

I had no people visiting my blog, nobody really reads what I write (laughs).

But now, with analytics, I would had actual proof that nobody reads what I write.

And so to avoid failure (and actually see my own ‚Äúfailure‚Äù) I stoped writing. If you don‚Äôt write anything, people can‚Äôt really ignore it.

Now, why the hell did I add analytics even in the first place? I think there was a level of me trying to genuinely know if people were even looking at what I am writing about and stop imagining or wondering if they did it or not (or just looking online for me).

But mostly I am starting to think that I was a bit boycotting myself from actually doing what I, maybe thought, I wanted to do.

Now‚Ä¶I do want to write. And I want to become better at writing, and so I am taking down analytics.

I might not be able to know who is watching but at least I can wonder again.
