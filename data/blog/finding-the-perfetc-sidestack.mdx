In this blog post I will document how I am going at with starting new projects, or how I would start a real project in July 2021. These are obviously very personal choices and this is not the stack I work with on my job. That being said, I do enjoy the search
for a stack that allows focusing on developing an idea that I have, leaving as much as possible all the annoiances behind.

## Motivations and preferences

Before we get into the tech choices I thought would be good to first of all put in here my thought process of the things I find value and I did want to very explicitely have in the stack I was looking for.

### Sass (software as a service)

Most of the things I am trying nowadays would fall into the Sass (software as a service) category, there is just something so appealing about the subscription model. Having one product to work on and improve, discuss problems with clients,
try to solve real world problems with software, that is afterall what I really like doing.

So some of the choices will be made based on this fact, that the end result has to have some sort of built-in sass features (pricing, auth etc..)

### Development speed

The choices I make here are for side projects, some will live longer, some will not even see the light of day, some others might live for just a little while. Mostly I am trying either real ideas to see if they have any kind of interest so its quite important that
I can do this as fast as possible.

### Backend as a service

I am a frontend developer, and I can't possibly say with enough emphasis how much I dread databases. I really do, I hate them. It's a must for me that I am not directly maintaining any kind of database myself for these projects. So this is a pretty big
thing in my choice process, that I need some sort of backend as a service (hasura, firebase, supabase etc.)

### Simplicity

This is kind of difficult to express, and its very tied to the Development speed motivation, the stack needs to be simple, I need to already know it (I want to solve a business problem not a technology problem or learn a new language) so I need to keep things simple, maintainable and small.

### Authentication

This is a funny one, somewhat related to the Backend as a service motivation, whatever backend as a service I choose should have authentication built-in. Its just not a problem I am really interested in solving. If the backend does not have it I would have to use some other
pre-made service for authentication. I just don't want to handle authentication myself for these projects.

### Simple hosting (as a service)

Hosting must also be a non-issue. It needs to be a git based hosting solution where I basically push my code and boom, its live.

### Open source

As much as possible keep things in the open source, you never know tomorrow, companies have pricing models that then change, I can't guarantee that any of this has possibility for me to pay for, so I need to make sure it's only my time
I am playing with.

## Tech choices

Ok, now that we are clear on what my motivations are, lets dig into the actual techonologies and tools I am using.

### Next.js

Alright, how can I say this without sounding like a total next fanboy..well, honestly I don't care about sounding like that since it's exactly what I am. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the first choice I made, and its because honestly I love working with it.
I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in my day job and on all the years I have been doing web development (with serveral framworks from .net, umbraco, wordpress, joomla, cakephp, drupal, angular) nothing gives me the amount of flexibility, opinions and direction that [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) gives me. It just puts me right on the pit of success in terms
of user experience, developer experience, speed of development and best practices.

I honestly don't see myself working on anything else (ofc I would if I would have to, but I don't need when I am making these kind of choices) because it just makes me so happy and feels so right on everything that I do.

The other reason I love [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is that they just have the same mental model and motivations that I have. They believe (and I believe too) that product and product experience should drive the tech decisions and not the other way around. It's very well suited for
developing products and so its for me a non-negotiable choice.

### Vercel

Lets get to hosting cause this one is also a quick one. I love working with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), I admit [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (which I also use at work) is pretty nice as well, but when I debate the two of them (and this might sound ridiculous) I choose vercel because they "gave birth" to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and its a "very" small way
of me to thank them, and if I get to pay them for this I will be happy.

Using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is simple, its quick, for hosting my requirements are indeed small but [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) ticks all the boxes perfectly.

### Supabase

This is a recent choice, I previously was doing everything in Drupal when it comes to the backend because its something I have worked with for so many years, I am familiar with it. But recently Drupal has grown way to complex for my needs here and like I mentioned Before
I don't want to maintain a database (and also a different tech stack for the backend) so "something as a service" was my need.

So I tried some things

#### Strapi

I really like CMS's, I have worked with CMS's (especially Drupal) for a very long time and so I gave [strapi](https://strapi.io/) a spin, it was really great. The admin interface is great, modeling data is super easy, and its javascript which keeps everything in the same language ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is also javascript) and so it
seemed like a great choice. Unfortunately there were some things that led me to choose something else :

- No authentication built in (but was easy to setup with next-auth.js)
- No cloud hosting (I would have to host it myself)

Given this I dediced to look for something more "out of the box".

#### Hasura

was excited about [hasura](https://hasura.io/), I am a big fan of GraphQL and that is something I was purposly chasing since it would allow me to keep the stack fairly close to my normal working setup. However Hasura does not have authentication,
and the docs sounded like a bit more than I wanted to invest on (simplicity). I must admit I might give Hasura a try some day.

#### firebase

I have used [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) in the past, its pretty nice and very close to what I wanted, however its not open source and getting data out of it or migrating away from it can be complicated (did this already in the past).

#### Supabase üèÜ

Given all of this [supabase](https://supabase.io/) was a standout. It had basically all the things I wanted

- Simple
- Cloud hosting
- Open source
- Integration with vercel (bonus)
- Authetication

The biggest letdown was not using GraphQL but given the simplicity I though was well worth the shot. been using it for a while and I am really enjoying it.

## Bonus - vercel subscription starterkit

As a bonus I recently found (and this helped a little bit with the supabase choice) that [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) has a [starterkit](https://github.com/vercel/nextjs-subscription-payments) for sass and subscription projects
with already built-in support for [supabase](https://supabase.io/), [stripe](https://stripe.com/) (not included in my choices because I think as I find if there is market or not I can always find workarounds for charging but on the only project I am currently charging I am using stripe) and also [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) which
is also something I have started using recently.

[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) was a hard pill to swallow but for this kind of projects I don't want to really have as much of the creative process as I usually want to have. I just need to make something look really nice as quick as possible and so I bought a subscription of [Tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/) which is actually money very well spent since not only I use the
components on my side projects it works also as a very nice inspiration source for work related ui things (even though we don't use tailwind).

## Let me know what you think

That is it. That's basically my recent process to choose what technology to use on new ideas and side projects, if you have some thoughts feel free to DM or ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/joaogarin) or [Polywork](https://www.polywork.com/joaogarin)
